            The last exam i had was math just 3 days ago. i'm so nervous and so stressed.
            i had prepared for it for month.I arrive 8:30 am before exam start. I sign my
            at front of reception. I waved to my friend, chatted classmate. i greeted to a 
            teacher . Teachers are preparing for the exam.I bought a orange juice to relax 
            and take a last time.
